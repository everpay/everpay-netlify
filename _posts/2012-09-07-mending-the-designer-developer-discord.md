A design is completed—photoshop templates, specs, images, and all—and handed
over to a third-party developer. The developer implements the design, but not
without some “creative” maneuvering to fill design gaps and override
functionality decisions lost in translation. The back and forward feedback
loop breaks down, and we end up with a shitty product.
<!--break-->
Such is the case with many agencies utilizing third-party vendors and even in-
house departments treating design and development as separate entities. Coming
from an agency background, I’ve seen firsthand the designer-developer
relationship condemned to the catacombs where design details go to die and
sound usability sits in limbo. Now working for
**[Balanced](http://www.balancedpayments.com)**, I am once again presented
with this challenge. How then, do we mend the designer-developer discord?

I am a designer by trade; **[Marshall](https://github.com/mjallday)** is a
developer, but by no means do we view each other as counterpoints to the same
project. The notion that design and development have conflicting roles is
detrimental to success. Approaching the task together with an open dialogue
allows us to avoid hold-ups by bringing design and development closer via an
iterative workflow. **Mark Otto, web platform designer at Twitter and creator
of Bootstrap, wisely said, “Good design is constant contact.”** I couldn’t
agree more. The benefits of working together allows for an ongoing exchange of
ideas and discussions around critical questions like, “is this added feature
worth the excess code?” or, “what’s done easily?” versus, “what’s nearly
impossible to execute?” We also avoid the guessing game, “what did you mean by
this behavior?” In this sense, despite our disparate titles, we feel we are
both intimately involved in producing a quality design, masterminding for
usability, and implementing the final product.

**Lessons learned:**

// ensure both designer and developer have a clear understanding of the
problems and objectives of the project

// keep an open dialogue and bounce ideas off of one another

// don't be afraid to iterate; the goal is not to get it perfect the first
time

// make informed design and engineering decisions by collecting feedback  from
the targeted audience, both during and after the development process
